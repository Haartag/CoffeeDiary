# CoffeeDiary

Just an app to study.
First version of app. Perhaps someday it will be finished.
 
 ToDO:
  - some refactoring - clean it!
  - edit card functional
  - share button
  - customizable card sorting
  
  - remove deleted images from storage - does it work now??
  - some sql-safety?
  - some tests
 
 Ideas:
  - Landscape orientation?
  - licenses page?
  - multiselection in coffee type spinner?
  - in itemCard: remove photo, make photo-based background?
